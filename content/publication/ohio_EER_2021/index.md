abstract: We explore how teachers unions affect education production by
  comparing outcomes between districts allocating new tax revenue amidst
  collective bargaining negotiations and districts allocating tax revenue well
  before. Districts facing union pressure increase teacher salaries and
  benefits, spend down reserves, and experience no student achievement gains.
  Conversely, districts facing less pressure hire more teachers (instead of
  increasing compensation) and realize significant student achievement gains. We
  interpret these results as causal evidence of the negative impact of teacher
  rent seeking on education production, as the timing of district tax elections
  relative to collective bargaining appears to be as good as random.
